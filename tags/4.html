<h2>REASONS TO ATTEND</h2>

<p>Attending the Project Management and Leadership Expo 2018 is an invaluable investment to your career, and we look forward to seeing you on July19 – 20 in Switzerland.</p>

<p>We want you to be there in Switzerland with other Leaders! Sometimes there is a need to convince your leadership reasons why you should attend, and below are some key areas of opportunity to help you prepare for the request:</p>

<p>Timing is everything: The cost is much lower earlier than later so getting youask in early is key. Consider discussing in your one on one meetings or over lunch.</p>

<p>Remember the Business Case: This conference will not only benefit you as a professional, but your organization will benefit as well with all the information you will be obtaining. Don’t forget to share this information. Within PML letting people know, “what’s in it for them” is important! Make an outline with bullet points or justifications on why it will benefit you and your organization. Show that you will make the most of it, and why networking and attending the workshops and sessions are important. Ask yourself what your short-term and long-term goals are with your organization’s objectives, and pair them with sessions that will contribute the most to the goals. Explain how it will make the company more profitable, functional and flexible.</p>
